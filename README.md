> A smart jsdoc generator

## Why should I heal my code?
Well, it's not like your code is sick or broken or anything of the sort. It's just that documenting it might be a real pain and it is something we want to waste as little time on as possible. Wouldn't it be better if we had a magical tool, that can:

* infer data types
* write jsdoc comments
* update jsdoc comments
* perform more behind the scenes jsdoc operations

JSDoctor is definitely  not there yet, but the idea is to continue developing and improving it. So far it is capible of basic type inferences and basic documentation. So if you would like to write as less as possible, JSDoctor is a great solution for you even at this stage of development!

## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoctor):

```sh
$ npm install --save jsdoctor
```

OR

```sh
$ npm install -g jsdoctor
```

## Usage

### Programmatically 
```js
const jsdoctor = require('jsdoctor');

jsdoctor('./lib/path/**/*.js').then(result => {
  console.log(result.status); // success
});
```

### Cli
```sh
$ jsdoctor "./lib/path/**/*.js" -w
```

## API
------

### Programmatically 
`jsdoctor(path, [options])`

#### Params:
* path - Either a `filepath` or a `glob`
* options (optional) - An `object` that may include the following properties:

| Option | Deafult | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| overrideComments | `false` | Whether JSDoctor should override existing comments or leave them be |
| watch | `false` | Whether JSDoctor should launch in watch mode (persistent) |

_Note_: The **overrideComments** option is very unrecommended as you can accidentally write over existing documentation you want to keep

#### Returns:

JSDoctor returns a promise but the value within that promise depends on the options provided.
Usually:

```js
jsdoctor(path).then(result => {
  console.log(result.status); // Either "success" or "failure"
  if (result.status === "failure") {
    console.log(result.error); // If doctoring was unsuccessful, the result will contain an error
  }
});
```

If the **watch** option is provided:

```js
jsdoctor(path,  {watch: true}).then(monitor => {
  console.log(monitor.files); // The monitored files
  monitor.killPatient(); // Stops files monitorig
  monitor.watchPatient(); // Start files monitoring again
});
```

### Cli
`jsdoctor <path> [options]`

* path - Either a `filepath` or a `glob`
* options (optional) - Additional `flag`s that change the functionality in the following ways:

| Option | Short | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| --overrideComments | -o | Whether JSDoctor should override existing comments or leave them be |
| --watch | -w | Whether JSDoctor should launch in watch mode (persistent) |

_Note_: The **overrideComments** flag is very unrecommended as you can accidentally write over existing documentation you want to keep

## Examples

#### Class
From this:

```js
class Point {

  constructor(x, y) {
      this.coordinates = {x, y};
  }

  toString() {
    return "(1,2)";
  }
}
```

To this:

```js
/**
 * A Point implementation
 */
class Point {

  /**
    * Creates a Point
    * @constructor
    * @param {*} x
    * @param {*} y
    */
  constructor(x, y) {
      this.coordinates = {x, y};
  }

  /**
   * @returns {string}
   */
  toString() {
    return "(1,2)";
  }
}
```

#### Function
From this:

```js
function diff(a, b = 1, opposite = false) {
    if (!a) throw new Error("The first argument wasn't provided");
    if (opposite) return b - a;
    return a - b;
}
```

To this:

```js
/**
 * @param {*} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @param {boolean} opposite
 * @returns {*}
 * @throws {Error} The first argument wasn't provided
 */
function diff(a, b = 1, opposite = false) {
    if (!a) throw new Error("The first argument wasn't provided");
    if (opposite) return b - a;
    return a - b;
}
```

#### Property
From this:

```js
get X() {
    return this.coordinates.x;
}

set X(x) {
    this.coordinates.x = x;
}
```

To this:

```js
/**
  * Get the value of the X property
  * @type {*}
  */
get X() {
    return this.coordinates.x;
}

/**
  * Set the value of the X property
  * @type {*}
  */
set X(x) {
    this.coordinates.x = x;
}
```

## Bugs

## Contributing

All contributions are very welcome and encouraged!
Please look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/yashag/jsdoctor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## TODO

There is still a lot of work, so every helping hand and suggestion is welcome! :)
The following assignments are among the most important for future releases:

* fix test failure when the result folder is empty
* improve the watch option test (replace setTimeout)
* replace file rewriting with file modification when inserting comments
* Improve type infence
* Add more options (like tags filtering)
* Add more tests (and possibly coverage statistics)
* Support more jsdoc tags
